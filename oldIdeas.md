## Idea number 1: Chlotilde

### Description of this idea 1

Chlotide is an application who is able to chat with seniors. Chatting with them can help them to be more autonomous and feel less alone.

### Why I wanted to create the idea 1 ?

- I think that it's important to help the seniors to be more autonomous. I think that the chatbot can help them to be more autonomous and to have a better life.
- Since my great-grandfather died, my great-grandmother is alone. She don't want to leave her house and she is very far from my family. I try to see her as much as I can but I can't be there every day. I think that the chatbot can help her to be more autonomous and to have a better life.

### How I planned to create the idea 1 ?

I planned to use an API to get the informations about the seniors and to use a chatbot to answer to the questions of the seniors.

### What already exists for the idea 1 ?

There is already a lot of chatbot who can help the seniors to be more autonomous like [Lena](https://www.startuphealth.com/lena). But I think that it's not enough. I think that we can do better. Like by implementing a oral chatbot.

## Idea number 2: VHisto

### Description of this idea 2

During this month, I had an idea, develop a VR application to give some interest to children about history. With this, you would be able to visit some historical places and to see how it was in the past. Imagine discover prehistoric caves, visit the pyramids of Egypt or even see the American Independence Act.

### Why I wanted to create the idea 2 ?

I think that it could be a good idea to give some interest to children about history. 

### How I planned to create the idea 2 ?

I planned to use Unity to create the VR application.

### What already exists for the idea 2 ?

There is already a lot of VR application who can help the children to learn history like [Time Machine VR](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/1092474780792679/?locale=fr_FR). But I think that it's not enough. I think that we can do better, like adding some interactivity with the historical places, like being able to talk with the people who lived in the past, to see how they lived, etc. Also, I think that it could be a good idea to add some games to learn history.
