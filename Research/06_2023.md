# Research of June 2023

No answer from the deaf association. I think that I will not have an answer, that's why I will not wait for them. I will continue to work on my project and if they answer me, I will see if I can help them. Even if I think that there is no chance that they answer me.

During this month, I was asking myself the main questions of my project:

- What are the main features of my project?
- What are the main technologies that I will use?
- How will I do my project?
- How will I test my project?

Some are easy to answer, some are more difficult. I will try to answer them in the next months, before the oral presentation around october.
