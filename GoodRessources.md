Here's a list of potential ressources that might be useful for my project:

- A Google Kaggle competition about ASL (American Sign Language) recognition: [Kaggle ASL Fingerspelling Recognition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/asl-fingerspelling/overview)
- A YouTube video showing how does a sign language detection works thanks to Python: [Real Time Sign Language Recognition using Python | Computer Vision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sywpZ7o2gg)
- A PDF [Sign Language Recognition: A Comprehensive Review of Traditional and Deep Learning Approaches, Datasets, and Challenges](./Sign_Language_Recognition_A_Comprehensive_Review_o.pdf) that could be useful to understand the state of the art in sign language recognition.
- An argentinian website [LSA64: A Dataset for Argentinian Sign Language](https://facundoq.github.io/datasets/lsa64/) explaining how a video dataset works.
