## Idea number 1: Chlotilde

### Description

Chlotide is an application who is able to chat with seniors. I planned to use an API to get the informations about the seniors and to use a chatbot to answer to the questions of the seniors.

### Why ?

- I think that it's important to help the seniors to be more autonomous. I think that the chatbot can help them to be more autonomous and to have a better life.
- Since my great-grandfather died, my great-grandmother is alone. She don't want to leave her house and she is very far from my family. I try to see her as much as I can but I can't be there every day. I think that the chatbot can help her to be more autonomous and to have a better life.
