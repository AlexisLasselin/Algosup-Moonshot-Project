# April 2025 Recap

After a few months of hard work, I am happy to announce that I have completed the first version of my project of sign recognition. Everything is working as expected, and I am now in the process of writing the documentation, thing that I must do before June, to ensure that I'm not in a hurry regarding the deadline.

I have also taken the time to review my code and make some improvements such as:

- Refactoring some functions to make them more readable and efficient.
- Adding more comments to explain the code.
