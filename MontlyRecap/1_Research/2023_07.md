# Research of July 2023

This month, I didn't work a lot on my project. I was on scholar holidays and I was working in my student job who became a full time job during this period, but I made some work about the target market of my project:

Sadly, like everyone, deaf people can be victim of accidents, and the helpers are not always able to communicate with them.
The firefighters are the first helpers to arrive on the scene of an accident. They are trained to help people in danger, but they are not trained to communicate with deaf people. That's why my application will be useful for them. By just filming the victim, they will be able to communicate with him and to know what happened.

During the next month, I'll be unable to work on the moonshot project because I will be in holidays, but during September, I will prepare the oral presentation of the project, I need strong arguments to convince the jury that my project is useful and that it can be done.
