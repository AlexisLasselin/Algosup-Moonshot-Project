# Research of March 2023

During this month, I wasn't able to invest much time in the project, but I was able to make some progress and here is what I found:

Lena, already mentioned in the [old idea](../../oldIdeas.md#what-already-exists-for-the-idea-1), is a chatbot who can help the seniors to be more autonomous. I had the idea to combine the chatbot with an oral chatbot. I was thinking it could be a good idea but I saw on the Amazon Alexa website that there is already a collaboration with Lena. So I don't think that it's a good idea to do the same thing.

Now I have to think about a new idea. I will try to find a new idea during the next month but I don't know if I will be able to find something with what I would like to do. I will plan to do a lot of research about the subjects I am interested in: social and health.
