# Research of April 2023

This month, to be able to find a new idea, I did a lot of research about the subjects I am interested in. Then, I thought to my hobbies, work in an interesting domain is more motivating. That's why, in the early part of the month, I sent an email to the CREC (Comité Régional Escrime Centre) to get some information about handisport fencing.
On April 20th, I received their answer and I was able to talk with them. We talked a lot about technical and physical problems but there is not real "software" part on the solution.
I discussed with them deeper about fencing in generality and they told me something that I didn't expect: If I want to change something, I must contact the FIE (Fédération Internationale d'Escrime) because they are the one who can change the rules.
So, I concluded that it's not a good idea to work on this project and now I have to find a new idea about, if it's possible, something I like.
