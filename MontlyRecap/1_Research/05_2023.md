# Research of May 2023

During this month, I had an idea, develop a VR application to give some interest to children about history. With this, you would be able to visit some historical places and to see how it was in the past. Imagine discover prehistoric caves, visit the pyramids of Egypt or even see the American Independence Act. I think that it could be a good idea to give some interest to children about history. But in fact, I don't think that it's a good idea because it's not really a software project. It's more a project about history and I don't have the knowledge and the money to do something like that.

Finally, I may be have an idea, I contacted the deaf association of the department of Cher, located in Bourges, to know if I could help them with my. I'm waiting for their answer.
