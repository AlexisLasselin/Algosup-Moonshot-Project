# November Recap

During this month, my main idea, the translator for the sign language, has been approved, so I am now allowed to work on it for my whole school period. Before writing Functional specifications, I'm currently asking some questions to deaf / signing people to know what they think about my idea, and what they would like to see in it. I'm also trying to find some resources to learn how to make this software.
