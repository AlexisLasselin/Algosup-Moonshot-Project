# March 2024 recap

This month, after 3 months of several email discussions with [Com'Signes Centre Val-De-Loire](https://www.com-signes.fr), I finally had the chance to meet them at their premises in Orl√©ans.

During the meeting, I explained my project and how the school worked to make it a reality. The three people who took part in the meeting, 2 deaf and one hard-of-hearing, agreed that the idea works in such a way that you can switch from LSF to French and not the other way round, like [the Elix dictionary](https://dico.elix-lsf.fr) for example, which they criticize for having a lot of flaws.
