# March 2024 recap

This month, after 3 months of several email discussions with [Com'Signes Centre Val-De-Loire](https://www.com-signes.fr), I finally had the chance to meet them at their premises in Orléans.

During the meeting, I explained my project and how the school worked to make it a reality. The three people who took part in the meeting, 2 deaf and one hard-of-hearing, agreed that the idea works in such a way that you can switch from LSF to French and not the other way round, like [the Elix dictionary](https://dico.elix-lsf.fr) for example, which they criticize for having a lot of flaws.

To improve my understanding of how this project will be complicated, I searched for some companies that did something similar with the goal to get some advice. I found [Keia](https://keia.io) that is a company that does a part of what I want to do, the Read2Sign part. I contacted them and they weren't very helpful, but they gave me the contact of a searcher who's working on this topic. (You can find more about this [here](https://tals.lisn.upsaclay.fr/)).

I contacted Annelies Braffort, searcher at LISN (Laboratoire Interdisciplinaire des Sciences du Numérique) who said she's busy this month but she'll be available in April. The only feedback I got from her was the following:

> "Pour faire court en attendant : la traduction automatique LSF-> français ou français->LSF est un domaine de recherche très récent. 2 de nos doctorants travaillent sur ce sujet. Pour l'instant, une application opérationnelle est hors de portée. Les solutions existantes comme Keia comportent des parties non automatiques, indispensables pour assurer la qualité linguistique.
> Mon conseil : Il faut revoir à la baisse l'ambition initiale :)"

To sum up, I have to lower my goals, but I'm not sure to really lower them. Some companies such as [SignAll](https://www.signall.live) are already working on this topic and they have a working solution. I think I'll have to contact them to get some advice.
