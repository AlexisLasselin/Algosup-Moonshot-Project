# December 2023

For the end of the year, I started to think about the real requirements of my project.
To help me finding them, I created a google form and shared it on LinkedIn, I also contacted an association (Com'Signe CVDLoire) recommanded by a contact.

The month of January will be dedicated to the study of the answers to my form and also to increase my contacts for this project with the main objective to define the most important needs for deaf people.
