# May 2024 Recap

After several conversations with Com'Signes CVDL and also ALGOSUP's staff, I have the right to miss part of the school year to learn LSF.

I also had the chance to discuss with a lot of people about my project, and even if I got a lot of negative feedback, I'm just understanding why this project is a good Moonshot: The tasks are so various and complex that it's quite impossible to make it alone. That's why, instead of trying to make the whole project, I'll try to, instead, focus on one part of it, maybe the most important one: the interpretation of the sign by the computer.

For June and July, I'll try to prepare my documents to be ready to develop the product once I'll be done with my LSF learning, in November.
