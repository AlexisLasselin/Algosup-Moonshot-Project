# July 2024 monthly recap

This month, even I'm not working that much on my moonshot, regarding the fact that I'm working aside to pay the school, I'm still working on it.

Thanks to Dee's contact, Shradda, an deaf Indian entrepreneur, I had the chance to discuss with her about my project. She gave me a lot of feedback, and I'm really grateful for that.

During August, I'll plan to complete my functional specifications before learning LSF in October.
